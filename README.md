**Quantas** stands for **Quant**\itative **A**\nalysis of **S**\olids. It is an open source 
package in [Python](https://www.python.org/) for the analysis of the thermodynamics, and elastic properties of solid 
phases starting from theoretical or experimental results.

## Features

- Calculation of thermodynamics of solid systems at harmonic approximation 
  (HA) level

- Calculation of both thermodynamics and thermoelastic properties of solids at selected
  pressure and temperature conditions via quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA):

- Calculation of the equation of state (EoS) from experimental data

- Analysis of the second-orderelastic constants

- Being written in Python 3, Quantas is completely **cross-platform**!

## Installation

Please see Quantas' [documentation](https://quantas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## How to cite

If you use Quantas to produce data for a publication, you are kindly requested to cite the

Also, the theory behind the different kind of available calculations is discussed in specific
literature, and we kindly ask you to cite them accordingly.

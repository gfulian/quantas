Quantas documentation
=====================

**Quantas** stands for **Quant**\itative **A**\nalysis of **S**\olids. It is an open source 
package in Python_ for the analysis of the thermodynamics, and elastic properties of solid 
phases starting from theoretical or experimental results.

.. _Python: https://www.python.org/

Features
========

- Calculation of thermodynamics of solid systems at harmonic approximation 
  (HA) level

- Calculation of both thermodynamics and thermoelastic properties of solids at selected
  pressure and temperature conditions via quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA):

- Calculation of the equation of state (EoS) from experimental data

- Analysis of the second-orderelastic constants

- Being written in Python 3, Quantas is completely **cross-platform**!
